This is a tool for loading fglrx/Catalyst Xorg driver and initializing it.
The goal of it is to get the driver to init hardware power saving without
having to actually start the X server. This is useful for some AMD hardware
like evergreen that starts without power saving enabled (and even runs at
highest clocks) after reset and uses maximum fan speeds until the driver
starts, configures things, uploads ucode and does whatever else it has to do.

These days it's most likely better to just use the radeon driver, but I
still keep fglrx on my machine for somewhat better performance.
